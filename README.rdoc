= Moonshine_UploadProgress

IMPORTANT: Moonshine_UploadProgress is no longer supported.

=== A plugin for Moonshine[http://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine]

A plugin for installing and managing mod_upload_progress[http://www.railsillustrated.com/screencast-file-uploads-progress-in-rails-passenger.html].

The plugin will build and enable the module in Apache. You will also need to add the following to your manifest:

    configure(:passenger => { :vhost_extra => """
    <Location />
        # enable tracking uploads in /
        TrackUploads On
    </Location>

    <Location /progress>
        # enable upload progress reports in /progress
        ReportUploads On
    </Location>
    """})

The only available option at this time is shared_memory_size which defaults to 1024000 (100k). To adjust this, 
add to your moonshine.yml:

    :upload_progress:
      :shared_memory_size: 2048000

Then re-deploy.
